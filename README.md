# Model Evaluation Preparation for Medical Image Analysis

This project aims to evaluate convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for binary classification of medical images. We focus on two primary evaluation metrics and utilize a train-validation-test split method to ensure a realistic and efficient assessment of the models' performance.

## Introduction

This documentation details the preparation steps for evaluating two different CNN architectures in classifying medical images, specifically chest X-rays. The project focuses on robust metrics selection and a practical data division strategy.

## Metrics Selection

### Chosen Metrics:

1. **Accuracy**
   - Provides a general measure of model correctness, particularly effective when classes are balanced.

2. **Confusion Matrix**
   - Delivers detailed insights into the types of errors made by the model, which is crucial in medical settings to identify false negatives and false positives.

These metrics are selected for their relevance in clinical contexts, where detailed error analysis is critical for patient care.

## Data Division Method

### Train-Validation-Test Split:

- **Applicability**: This method is well-suited for large image datasets typical in medical applications.
- **Realistic Implementation**: Models are trained on historical data, fine-tuned on a validation set, and evaluated against unseen data.
- **Practicality**: Provides a balance between computational efficiency and thorough evaluation without the extensive computational demands of k-fold cross-validation.

## Model Architecture

We define two CNN models using TensorFlow's Keras API:

- **Model 1**: A simple baseline CNN.
- **Model 2**: A more complex CNN intended to achieve higher accuracy.

Each model is designed to classify images into two categories, leveraging convolutional layers for feature extraction and dense layers for classification.

## Usage

To run this evaluation:

1. **Set Up Environment**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Execute the Model Training and Evaluation**:
   ```bash
   python train_evaluate.py
   ```

This script will preprocess the data, train the models, and output the evaluation metrics.

## Results

- **Training and Validation Metrics**: Plots of accuracy and loss during the training of both models.
- **AUC Scores**: Comparison of the area under the ROC curve for both models to assess their discriminatory power.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Scikit-Learn
- NumPy
- PIL
- Matplotlib
